- **Target Variable**: TotalClaims (subset where claims > 0)
- **Models Implemented**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
  - LightGBM Regressor
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE (primary), R-squared, MAE, Cross-validation scores
- **Business Value**: Enables accurate financial liability estimation for reserve planning

### ✅ 2. Claim Probability Prediction (Binary Classification)

- **Objective**: Predict probability of a claim occurring
- **Target Variable**: HasClaim (0/1 binary classification)
- **Models Implemented**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - LightGBM Classifier
- **Evaluation Metrics**: AUC-ROC, Average Precision, F1-Score, Cross-validation AUC

- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV AUC for stability assessment

## 🚀 Dynamic Pricing Framework

### Implementation Formula

```
Risk-Based Premium = (Claim Probability × Expected Claim Severity) +
                    (Expected Claims × Expense Ratio) +
                    (Expected Claims × Profit Margin)
```

### Business Parameters

- **Expense Ratio**: 25% (adjustable business parameter)
- **Profit Margin**: 15% (adjustable business parameter)
- **Expected Claim Severity**: Model-predicted or historical average
